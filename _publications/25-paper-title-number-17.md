excerpt: 'With the advancement of satellite communication technology, the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has made significant progress. As a result, vast amounts of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from global vessels are transmitted to various maritime stakeholders through Maritime IoT systems. AIS data contains a large amount of dynamic and static information that requires effective and intuitive visualization for comprehensive analysis. However, two major deficiencies challenge current visualization models: a lack of consideration for interactions between distant pixels and low efficiency. To address these issues, we developed a large-scale vessel trajectories visualization algorithm, called the Non-local Kernel Density Estimation (NLKDE) algorithm, which incorporates a non-local convolution process. It accurately calculates the density distribution of vessel trajectories by considering correlations between?'
