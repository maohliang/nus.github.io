excerpt: 'Maritime transportation is a critical component of global trade and commerce. To ensure maritime safety, fixed shipping routing has been established in many complex waters.

It is essentially a hierarchical approach, which progresses from port to route. In particular, for the extraction of port-level shipping networks, the clustering in quest (CLIQUE) and alpha-shapes algorithms are employed to accurately extract the boundaries and spatial extents of individual ports.
