collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024/1/25-paper-title-number-14
excerpt: '?&quot;With the advancement of satellite and 5G communication technologies, vehicles can transmit and exchange data from anywhere in the world. It has resulted in the generation of massive spatial trajectories, particularly from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) for surface vehicles. The massive AIS data lead to high storage requirements and computing costs, as well as low data transmission efficiency. These challenges highlight the critical importance of vessel trajectory compression for surface vehicles. However, the complexity and diversity of vessel trajectories and behaviors make trajectory compression imperative and challenging in maritime applications. Therefore, trajectory compression has been one of the hot spots in research on trajectory data mining. The major purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive reference source for beginners involved in vessel trajectory compression.?'
