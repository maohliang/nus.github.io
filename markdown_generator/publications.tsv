2022/1/7	Deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime Internet of Things	IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering	"The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness."	"Liu, R. W., Liang, M., Nie, J., Lim, W. Y.

2021/4/1	An unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation	Ocean Engineering	"To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results."	"Liang, M., Liu, R.

2022/4/8	STMGCN: Mobile Edge Computing-Empowered Vessel Trajectory Prediction Using Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	"The revolutionary advances in machine learning and data mining techniques have contributed greatly to the rapid developments of maritime Internet of Things (IoT). In maritime IoT, the spatio-temporal vessel trajectories, collected from the hybrid satellite-terrestrial automatic identification system (AIS) base stations, are of considerable importance for promoting traffic situation awareness and vessel traffic services, etc. To guarantee traffic safety and efficiency, it is essential to robustly and accurately predict the AIS-based vessel trajectories (i.e., the future positions of vessels) in maritime IoT. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal multigraph convolutional network (STMGCN)-based trajectory prediction framework using the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm. Our STMGCN is mainly composed of three different graphs, which are, respectively, reconstructed according to the social force, the time to closest point of approach, and the size of surrounding vessels. These three graphs are then jointly embedded into the prediction framework by introducing the spatio-temporal multigraph convolutional layer. To further enhance the prediction performance, the self-attention temporal convolutional layer is proposed to further optimize STMGCN with fewer parameters. Owing to the high interpretability and powerful learning ability, STMGCN is able to achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The reliable prediction results are potentially beneficial for traffic safety management and intelligent vehicle navigation in MEC-enabled maritime IoT."	"Liu, R.

2022/7/21	Fine-Grained Vessel Traffic Flow Prediction with a Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	"The accurate and robust prediction of vessel traffic flow is gaining importance in maritime intelligent transportation system (ITS), such as vessel traffic services, maritime spatial planning, and traffic safety management, etc. To achieve fine-grained vessel traffic flow prediction, we will first generate the maritime traffic network (which is essentially a graph), and then propose a graph-driven neural network. In particular, to represent various correlations among spatio-temporal vessel traffic flow, we tend to extract the feature points (i.e., starting, way and ending points) by utilizing the knowledge of vessel positioning data. These feature points are essentially related to the geometrical structures of massive vessel trajectories collected from massive automatic identification system (AIS) records, contributing to the generation of maritime traffic network. We then propose a spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network (STMGCN)-based vessel traffic flow prediction method by exploiting multiple types of inherent correlations in the generated maritime graph. The proposed STMGCN mainly contains one spatial multi-graph convolutional layer and two temporal gated convolutional layers, beneficial for extracting spatial and temporal traffic flow patterns. The main benefit of our graph-driven prediction method is that it takes full advantage of the maritime graph and multi-graph learning. Comprehensive experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS dataset to compare our method with several state-of-the-art prediction methods. The fine-grained prediction results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness."	"Liang, M., Liu, R. W., Zhan, Y., Li, H., Zhu, F., & Wang, F. Y. (2022).

2021/11/1	MVFFNet: Multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification	Pattern Recognition Letters	"The accurate classification of moving ships is of fundamental importance to maritime authorities for ensuring the safety and security of shipping operations. With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories"	"Liang, M., Zhan, Y., & Liu, R.

2022/12/15	"Ship collision risk analysis: Modeling, visualization and prediction"	Ocean Engineering	"Ship collisions are the primary threat to traffic safety in the sea, which can seriously threaten human lives, the environment and material assets. Therefore, the detection and analyze of ship collision risks have important theoretical significance and application value. To improve maritime safety and efficiency, we propose a modeling, visualization and prediction framework to analyze ship collision risk. In particular, to fully consider the maneuverability of the ship, we introduce the quaternion ship domain (QSD) into the vessel conflict ranking operator (VCRO). In addition, to further analyze and better understand collision risk, the kernel density estimation (KDE) model is employed to visualize the ship collision risk. The ship collision risk usually contains underlying patterns and laws.

2023/7/1	QSD-LSTM: Vessel trajectory prediction using long short-term memory with quaternion ship domain	Applied Ocean Research	"Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical aspect of ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network and its extensions have represented powerful ability of vessel trajectory prediction. However, the previous studies often did not take dynamic interactions between neighboring vessels into account. Additionally, in complex traffic conditions, trajectory prediction will acquire uncertainty, and these potential negative factors can limit the prediction of future trajectory. To enhance the prediction performance, we propose an interactive vessel trajectory prediction framework (i.e., QSD-LSTM) based on LSTM, which is embedded with the quaternion ship domain (QSD). The QSD is beneficial for avoiding unwanted collision between neighboring vessels. In addition, the operation of trajectory clustering is further incorporated into our trajectory prediction framework, potentially"	"Liu, R. W., Hu, K., Liang, M., Li, Y., Liu, X., & Yang, D. (2023).
